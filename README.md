# Practicum-II-Used-Car-Analysis
The used car business is massive and one of the hardest parts to get right is finding the right price to resell any vehicle. How does mileage, year, make, etc., affect car price? And ultimately how much is my car worth? A big part of my family works in the automobile industry and that got me to thinking about how cars are priced and more specifically used cars. From talking to one used car associate I was told they use Kelly Blue Book to estimate their car prices. What I am tring to do here is mimic that. 

## The Dataset
The dataset I used was retrieved from kaggle and was scraped of Craiglist's used car section from 2021. The dataset contains a little under 427k points. If you know anything about web scraping you know how difficult it can be to clean scraped data.
